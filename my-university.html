    <h1>Rutgers University – Newark</h1>
	
	<p style="font-size: 1.5rem; text-align: left;">Below is some information and historical background about Rutgers Newark, where I am currently undertaking
	 a second-degree program in Computer Science and Mathematics. Note that additional information can be found on Wikipedia.</p>
	
	<ul style="font-size: 1.5rem; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.6;">
	  <li>Rutgers University–Newark is one of three campuses that make up Rutgers University. It’s located in Newark’s University Heights neighborhood, spread out over a compact 38-acre urban campus.</li>

	  <li>While Rutgers itself was founded way back in 1766, the Newark campus came into the picture in 1946, when it merged with the former University of Newark after Rutgers became New Jersey’s official state university.</li>

	  <li>Rutgers–Newark is home to over 12,000 students and offers a mix of undergraduate and graduate programs. It includes seven schools, like the School of Public Affairs and Administration, Rutgers Business School, and Rutgers Law.</li>

	  <li>There’s a strong research presence here — including places like the Institute of Jazz Studies — and students can even take courses at NJIT, which borders the campus.</li>

	  <li>Fun fact: U.S. News & World Report calls Rutgers–Newark the most diverse national university in the country.</li>
	</ul>
